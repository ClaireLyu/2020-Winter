-   [Rule 2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#infix-operators): Most infix operators (`==`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.) should always be surrounded by spaces. 

-   [Rule 2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#commas): Always place a space after a comma, never before, just like in regular English. 


-   [Rule 2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#parentheses): Place a space before left parenthesis, except in a function call. Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets. Exception: Always place a space after a comma.
