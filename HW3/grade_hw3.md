### R code style: 20/20

-   [Rule 2.5](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#long-lines): Strive to limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font.

-   [Rule 2.4](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#indenting): 2 spaces for indenting.

-   [Rule 2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#infix-operators): Most infix operators (`==`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.) should always be surrounded by spaces. 

-   [Rule 2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#commas): Always place a space after a comma, never before, just like in regular English. 


-   [Rule 2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#parentheses): Place a space before left parenthesis, except in a function call. Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets. Exception: Always place a space after a comma.
