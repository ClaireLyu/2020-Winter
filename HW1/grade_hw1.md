-   Q3 (15/15)


-   Q4 (14/15)

### Usage of Git: 8/10

-   Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch? 

    Yes. 

-   Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 

    Yes. 

          
-   Is the hw1 submission tagged? 

    Yes. `hw1`. 

-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 

    Yes.
  
-   Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. (-2 pts)

### Reproducibility: 10/10

	  Yes. 
	  
-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

    Yes.

### R code style: 20/20

-   [Rule 2.5](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#long-lines): Strive to limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font. 


-   [Rule 2.4](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#indenting): 2 spaces for indenting.

-   [Rule 2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#infix-operators): Most infix operators (`==`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.) should always be surrounded by spaces. 

-   [Rule 2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#commas): Always place a space after a comma, never before, just like in regular English. 


-   [Rule 2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#parentheses): Place a space before left parenthesis, except in a function call. Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets. Exception: Always place a space after a comma.
